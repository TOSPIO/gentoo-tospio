# gentoo-tospio
TOSPIO official Gentoo overlay

## How to use
We have no plan yet on adding this overlay to ``overlays.gentoo.org``. You'll have to do the following:

```bash
$ layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TOSPIO/gentoo-tospio/master/repositories.xml -f -a gentoo-tospio
```

That's it! Sync your repo with any tools you're comfortable with, e.g. ``eix-sync``, and have fun :)
